# EmSys_lecture3

This lecture is used to explore how the worst case execution time (WCET) of applications on embedded systems can need careful consideration. It comapares the WCET running on two different platforms, on embedded linux running on a Dual core ARM Zynq system (PYNQ board), and as a standalone application running on an ESP32 board.

It also investigates how to respond to inputs quickly exploring polling-based and interrupt-based approaches on the ESP32.
