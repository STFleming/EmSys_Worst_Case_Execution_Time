# EmSys: Worst Case Execution Time (WCET) and Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)

Imagine you've been asked to design an embedded systems for an aircraft, car, or a medical device.
These are embedded-systems where the operation of the device must be precise and correct.
One _very_ important consideration when designing a system is how long things take to execute.

Imagine you're responsible for designing part of an accelerator control system for a self-driving car. Your subsystem takes in readings from a LIDAR sensor, processes them, and sends the output to the accelerator controller. You may have quite a powerful microcontroller for your subsystem that can comfortably process the sensor data quickly and efficiently without too much trouble. However, if there is even a tiny chance that your system takes longer than it should, then you can have a big problem.

If your subsystem takes too long to process, it may result in a danger to life. Okay, but there are always risks in these things; what if the task's delay is incredibly rare? Even if this is the case, it can present a severe issue. Imagine the self-driving car you are working on is deployed millions of times and runs for ten or more years. Suddenly the probabilities of even those very rare-events are starting to creep up, and any danger to life is unacceptable when we can design to avoid it.

__When designing such embedded systems it is crucial that:__

1. Tasks need to execute with precise timing guarantees
2. Embedded systems need to respond to external events with predictable timings

To make safe embedded systems, we need to ensure that our devices behave predictably concerning timing. To do that, we need to look into where unpredictable delays creep into typical systems and make the execution time non-deterministic.

A deterministic program is usually one where the program's outputted data is the same every single execution. However, with real-time systems, we take a stricter view on determinism and say that:

__The programs outputted data _and the timings of the outputs_ should be the same every execution__

Our desktop computers are throughput orientated machines. They aim to get the most work done in a given time. If we have many tasks, the computer can execute them in an arbitrary order to maximise the most output. Typical machines are also __abstracted__ to hide the system's timings to relieve the programmer's burden. Think about it: when you read or write to a variable in your program, or access a pointer, do you ever need to care how long it takes to fetch it from the memory subsystem? It's all completely invisible to you.

For real-time systems, such as the self-driving car we discussed earlier, timing is essential. This requirement means that different abstractions are required. After looking at the sources of non-determinism in typical computer systems, we will look at something called a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS). An RTOS puts the programmer in control of the timings of tasks.

### Sources of non-determinism

Variations in execution time occur at all levels of the computer stack and in many different places. Some examples at various levels are:

1. OS scheduler: when deciding which task to execute when
2. Virtual Memory
3. I/O: Arbitration and access to busses
4. In the Memory Hierarchy: disk -> RAM -> cache L2 -> cache L1
5. Internally within the CPU: branch prediction, speculative execution

Let's dig into a few of these in a bit more detail; unfortunately, we don't have time to explore everything that can introduce non-determinism (that would take a while).


## Demonstration

We are going to compare the execution of a benchmark function on two different platforms.

1. An dual-core (800MHz) ARM processor running Linux
2. Our ESP32 (230MHz) device                    

The benchmark we will use is a matrix-vector multiplication, a typical operation used in machine learning applications or signal processing. 

Our benchmark code looks like this:

```C
volatile float rvec [125];
volatile float rmat [125][125];
float res [125];

void compute(){
  for(int i=0; i<125; i++) {
    res[i] = 0.0;
    for(int j=0; j<125; j++) {
      res[i] += rvec[j] * rmat[i][j];    
    }
  }
}
```
